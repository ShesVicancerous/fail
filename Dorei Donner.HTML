<strong>I'll never forget that day, the day I found out I was a goddess.</strong>
 <hr>


 <p><br>&nbsp; Hello! I am the dazzling, delightful Doerei Donner. I am currently 22 (23 this year) but my story begins 5 years ago in a small miniscule town in Greece. 
    I lived with my father, he was a carpenter so we lived modestly (we also had a cat but I hated the damn thing so we won’t talk about her). 
    I was a singer/storyteller reciting Greek legends in song form to the town’s children. I miss those days, when I had an audience of eager faces and open ears hanging on my every word but nothing can last forever.
I wish I could say it was like any other day --well really I don’t because that would be cliche-- It wasn’t a normal day, it was my 18th birthday and my father sat me down looked me dead in the eyes and said “you’re the daughter of the muse of music”. 
I burst out laughing, obviously it was preposterous! Comical even! “You’re joking, yes? That's impossible”. Then he went into this long winded tale of how he and my ethereal mother met.
It was the typical boy-meets-beautiful-girl-who-just-happens-to-be-singing-in-the-middle-of-a-forest-for-no-reason-totally-not-trying-to-atraact-any-male-attention.
</p>
 They talk, they fall in love and-- oops! She gets pregnant and-- oops again! Turns out she's married to a river god! 
Then she gives the bastard child to the father so the husband won’t find out, (it is quite the scandal). I just couldn't believe it. Me?
 The bastard daughter of Euterpe? The more I thought of it though, the <strong>dazzling, dynamic Doerei Donner</strong> being the daughter of a muse didn’t seem all that odd. 
 Still my mind was racing. “Does this mean that I’m going to get my own tale like all the other gods?? AM I GOING TO GET WORSHIPERS!?!?!?” 
Once my father had finished telling his tale I obviously wanted to go looking for her not just to meet my mother but to get some answers! To my shock he said no. 
“What!? So you’re just going to tell me this long love story in your excruciating storytelling style by the way! 
Then just expect me to live with it!? Live with the knowledge that I, the dazzling Doerei Donner, am a demigoddess!?” 
<strong>“Yes.” </strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>The audacity!</strong> I was livid! Then again I was also an adult, so technically I didn’t need his permission but at the very least I wanted his approval, he's my father after all! The only one I'll ever get and the only parent I know. 
So I asked him why? Then he gives me this speech about how I was “irresponsible” and how he’d never be able to “live with himself if I died”.
 Oh come on, how cliche “it seems in your old age you’ve lost your ability to come up with a story original enough for me to at least feel a little sorry for you.” “I’m 42 you cruel child.” 
I knew how I could win him over though, a promise, a sincere promise. A Blood Oath. I remember going to my bedroom and getting my dagger then cutting my palm.
 I came back out and held it up to father, promising that I wouldn't die, promising I would “find my mother and come back one day”. I held my dagger handle to him, his eyes filled with tears as he took it and he cut his own palm. 
</p>
 Within the week I was packed and on my way to-- well I didn’t know where, I still don’t. But I digress. 
So I set off but not before my father gave me a guitar. He told me that mother had given it to him the last time he saw her, which is when he met me. He said he had tried to play it but after thorough examination he realized the technology was too advanced for him. 
So he concluded that it was probably for me, and thus sent me off with it. I value this guitar with my life, I named it Rodrick after him. 
So how’d I get here? Well I went off to a Euterpe temple, prayed for a bit and got no response obviously; Out of nowhere a demigod bard popped up. So I guess all that kneeling wasn't for nothing. He soon became my mentor. Aithie is his name and I’ve learned some things from him but he says I still have a lot to learn.
 He's also the one who told me to write my life story out, said something about 'itll help to get your thoughts down on paper' but I think he just wants to read it. The nosy bastard.
