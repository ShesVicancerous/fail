(This is the first backstory I ever wrote so please forgive the terrible writing)

<body>
    <p>
<strong>It all started back in Vodia when I was 15</strong>. 
Back when things were simple. I would wake up just as the sun was peaking over the horizion, say hello to the wind and the waves and get ordered around by my mother all day (something I didnt mind) and then dance the night away in our townâ€™s dancing hall. 
Things wernt always perfect but life was easy.
I had one parent and one sibling, my mother and baby brother the only ones I really care about in this world if im honest. 
My father had fell ill and passed a long while ago.
</p>

My home was a land underwater (for the most part that is) it was called <strong>Vodia</strong> and although it was big enough to be considered a town we didnt take to outsiders too much. 
None ever really left and most people who came were turned away. We liked to be left alone Indescribable.
Miles long lit up by nothing other than bioluminesent fire coral. Grand structures like palaces carved out of submurged mountains and filled with towers, homes, markets just like any land city.
The main places I remember were the Dancing hall, A special room we had for growing aqatic flora and fauna our green room I guess you could say, Then this place where where we made and stored weapons so it was like an armory of sorts.
Having both gills and lungs along with webbed feet we were able to be a people both thriving under and above the waves. 
If my memory serves me then there was a large island that sat on top of our record hall 'Neptune' that sat above the waves. 
It was round with a circumference of 4 kilometers I used to play there some days and most nights. My people were warriors, living by a monotheistic christian faith. 
My people just about from birth were trained to be <strong>great warriors</strong>, I spent most of my days on that huge island right above Neptune training from dawn to dusk. My mother was my favorite trainer (and probably the best fighter in the city). 
</p>

<p>
I had a set routine: wake at dawn, train till noon, afterwards go to worship, play till dusk, then return to the waves to do it all over again tomorrow. I wish I could go back.
One day boats, not just boats but ships of the High elves from the east, came as the rising sun to blot us out and didn't even bother to tell us why. 
As soon as those monsters stepped on our shores a battle ensued we fought with our hearts and souls but in the end we were no match for the elves our numbers dwindled quickly and my mother was lost.
Before my mother left this world she told me to keep my faith no matter what. 
She told me to board and hide on an elven ship until I made it to a new land far far away from that one but I couldn't bare to leave her behind but she took my hand then placed my brother's in it and begged me to leave.
I had no choice the last thing she told me was that I was her favorite daughter.
