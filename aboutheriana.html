<br> Two years ago it would've been the <strong> <abbr title="Secure Contain Protect"> SCP</abbr> foundation</strong>, right now though its the backrooms and i'm currently in the process of writing a level!

<br>&nbsp; Other than that I kind of just go day by day doing chores studying. I'm homeschooled so I just kind of stay in the house all day although it's great and all there have been some downsides‚Ä¶..

<h3> Personal issuesüíì </h3>
<hr>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;Due to my rare interaction face to face with people outside of family and neighbors, I've developed social anxiety and paired with my <strong><abbr title="Attention Defecit Hyper Disorder"> ADHD </abbr></strong> it hasn‚Äôt exactly been easy being me for the last 4 years. 
Now don‚Äôt me wrong when I say <strong>‚Äúsocial anxiety‚Äù</strong> I don‚Äôt mean low self-esteem or low-confidence I radiate high self-esteem <strong>and</strong> confidence I just have a problem with how i'm perceived in certain public situations and it's hard for me to speak to in select social situations <strong>(especially when i‚Äôm alone)</strong>. </p>

<p>
It's gotten a lot better now though, but it was really bad to the point where I could barely even go into a store by myself without crying before, during or after the event. Not like full on sobbing (at least not always) but y'know just a few tears here and there.
 It's gotten much better now though. 
 Now I can talk to someone like a school official or Grocery cashier without having a nervous breakdown (<strong>getting put on the spot still fucks me up</strong> but I think thats normal). I still get nervous sometimes and I don‚Äôt go out much but things are better.

<h3> What I intend to do with my lifeüíê </h3>

 Not talking about the ones you have when your body incapacitates itself for up to 12 hours or less I mean hopes and goals for the future mine are simple: 
 Live well and be happy but how I intend to get there is: 
</p>

</p>
<ol>
<li><br>I study really frickin hard</li>
<li><br>I take the GED test (at least the math portion) sometime between may and june (hopefully before)</li>
<li><br>I enroll in community college and get my associates in civil engineering</li>
<li><br> I transfer to USC and get my bachelors in architecture (or masters if want to torture myself)</li>
<li><br>I become a world famous architect (or not thats fine) and i build my dream house and a dodecahedron shaped building </li>
</ol>
